    <p>Hey, I’m Daniel, and I’m from Colombia. Right now, I’m studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College in Toronto. I chose this program because I’ve always had a strong passion for both creativity and technology, and this field lets me bring them together. I love exploring how design shapes user experiences and how visuals can be used to tell meaningful stories.

    I love playing soccer—it’s my go-to way to stay active and have fun. I also have a passion for photography, capturing moments and experimenting with different styles. When I’m not on the field or behind the camera, I enjoy watching movies, especially those with great storytelling and cinematography. I’m really into technology and love keeping up with the latest innovations. Fashion is another interest of mine—I appreciate stylish shoes and clothes that make a statement. Whether I’m out exploring or just diving into my favorite hobbies, I’m always looking for new inspiration!</p>
